Insert mode is where you can type as usual, like in any other editor. Visual mode is a way to visually select text for further manupulation. Command mode you are able to run different commands, such as the subsitute command, by typing the ':' character first, then the command. An example of that would be ':%s/Deerk/Derek/g' which will correct any typos of my name from 'Deerk' to 'Derek', on all lines, for as many occurences as there are per line. `),e("br"),e("br"),t(" But the motions also hit a breaking point.
