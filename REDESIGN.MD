# general guidelines/ideas
- **IMPORTANT**: the content on the pages are very good. we need to present it better
- focus on professional design and ease of access + accessibility
- minimal animations and hover effects
- no jargon-y and bullshit descriptions
- name, role, and based out of should be prominent
    - maybe an icon or a map or something for the based out of
- dont use an api to generate images for things like github and leetcode stats, maybe try to get it yourself
    - i am hosted on github pages
    - can i use rust WASM?
- basic web portfolio
    - subpage with a terminal experience?
    - subpage with a gamelike experience?
- tokyonight theme
- focus on basic stuff, minimal design, no bloat, no extra stuff
- use an icon set, not emojis
- style it as my own, not just puzzle piecing things together
- for PII (phone number, email, etc) use a copy button rather than like a mailto: link for better ux
- try to best fit the site so that things like darkreaders do not break or affect the website
- DO NOT USE A SKELETON OR TEMPLATE
- easy keyboard nav / accessibility

# as far as the critiques go:
- remove the qr code, consider making a /links page with a condensed version of all of my links
- the picture i have is the only good one. it will be kept
- remove the quickmouse mascot picture
- the resume interaction should be better
- minimize unneed effects, the only thing that should have effects are things that appear clickable
